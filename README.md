# Everlife Coupon

![elife-coupon](elife-coupon.png)

## The Problem
The Everlife Avatar, on startup, creates a new Stellar wallet account
for itself. However, this account is not funded. The user needs to fund
the account in order for it to be available for work on the Everlife
network.

Users must also set up a trustline to accept `EVER` currency in order to
get paid. This process is a little tedious and so, in order to make it
easier for users to do this we provide coupons that the user can
purchase and redeem to get their avatars up and running.

## The Everlife Marketplace
While anyone can design and release a coupon system (or indeed any other
kind of service that would help users activate their avatar wallets)
[Everlife.ai](https://everlife.ai) provides coupons on the
[marketplace](https://github.com/everlifeai/everlife-marketplace) that
this skill can redeem.

Use:

        /coupon <serial number>


To redeem your coupons
